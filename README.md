# LighthouseAutomation

Solution with nestjs backend and angular frontend for manual or scheduled creation of google lighthouse reports.

The project started more than two years ago for quality checks of http://taz.de.
It was not finished and was abandoned for a while.
I move the seperated old projects to a single nx workspace at the moment, including a lot of refactoring and lib creation.

## Backend Development server

Run `nx serve lha-backend` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Frontend Development server

Run `nx serve lha-frontend` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.
